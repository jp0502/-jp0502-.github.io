        <p>
            Hi, my name is John (sometimes I go by Jonghoon), and I'm a 4th year Applied Mathematics and Economics student at York University. I love Mathematical Finance and Data Science!
        </p>

        <p>
            I am most experienced in implementing machine learning models and data analysis methods, and my go-to tool of choices are Python, mySQL and MATLAB. I also dabble in Java.

                    Developed a kNN classifier in Python with sklearn library to perform predictions on whether a credit card usage is
                    fraudulent on a Kaggle dataset (n=284,807)
                    
                    </p>
                    <p>Normalized and trained the kNN classifier algorithm via Euclidean

                    Performed Precision-Recall Area Under Curve method to determine performance of the kNN algorithm to yield
